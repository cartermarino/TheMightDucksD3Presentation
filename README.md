###D3.js

======

**D3.js** is a JavaScript library which helps make your data come to life using HTML, CSS, and SVG. **D3** gives you more power to manipulate the data without **tying yourself to a framework.** It has the power of binding arbitrary data to the DOM and then transform it.

####Just add thist line to your head tag
```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/d3/3.5.6/d3.min.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```


**D3** is extremely fast, supporting large datasets and dynamic behaviors for interaction and animation. It is like jQuery, but also works for SVG.
